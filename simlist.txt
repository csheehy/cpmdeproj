000 - 20x20 noiseless T template, no QU template, standard beam
      (i.e. no 1% power uniform quadrupoloar sidelobe at 8 degrees)

001 - Same as 001 but now with QUtemptype='s4', Ttemptype='planck'
    -001_wzdp = fitting wz, predicting wcz and wsz
    -001_wczwszdp = fitting concat(wcz,wsz), predicting same
    -001_cpm = same as 001_wczwszdp but adding CPM type template (split by ra
    	       median)
    -001_perdk = Okay, all of 001 was first coadding over all dk angles and then
              fitting. This seems to give noisier prediction in the noise only sims, and
    	  especially so for CPM (ra right/left) fitting. So 002 switches to fitting
	  on a per dk angle basis before coadding. Additionally, the CPM fitting is
      	  change d to fit wcz and wsz simultaneously, which differs from 001, where
      	  CPM fitting fit wz and then predicted wcz and wsz. This helps some, but
      	  the biggest benefit seems to be from per-dk angle fitting, which results
      	  in a smaller amplitude prediction of both regular and CPM predictions in
     	   the noise only sims. This seems a bit counterintuitive to me.
    
    -001_alpha1 = Don't coadd over dk but fit all dks simultaneously. Also, fit wz and
                 predict wcz and wsz, always. alpha=1
    -001_newridge_alpha1 = TOTALLY NEW RIDGE IMPLEMENTATION! Normalization, y-fitting, no
                           penalty for Q/U feature. Split CPM fitting by median RA
                           of entire map rather than non-zero pixels.
    -001_newridge_alpha0 = same but alpha=0
                           
                           


002 - input map = E and B, lensing + dust B-modes, Nside=1024 input map,
      degraded to 256 for deprojetion template. QUtemptype='s4',
      Ttemptype='planck'

003 - same as 002 but TE set to zero in the input map Cl's.
